# Analysing herding behaviour in digital currency markets using agent-based modelling (ABM) and network models

With this analysis, presented in the paper (found under the ```Report``` directory) written by myself, Silvia Juzova, Fabian Kraus and Louis Lacombe, we are trying to see how an individual’s 
propensity to buy affects macro-trend movements. Focusing specifically on the cryptocurrency market described by high collineariaty between assets and the herding phenomena.

## Abstract

Complex financial systems exhibit universal market failures that are unaccounted for
under traditional finance theory and modelling. In this paper a novel approach to modelling
financial phenomena is applied to both analyse and predict extreme price changes, market bubbles,
in the cryptocurrency market. Individual’s propensity to buy was identified as a main driver of
price changes, leading to big price swings driven by relatively small changes in overall level of
belief. The model performed well at identifying relative price direction, allowing it to be used as
an early price deviance indicator.
